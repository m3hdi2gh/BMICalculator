# BMI Calculator Project

This project is part of the Advanced Programming Course (Spring 2024). It's a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application written in Java, simulating the process of calculating BMI based on user's height and weight.

## Features :star2:

- **Gender Selection**: Choose between Male or Female.
- **Height Input**: Enter your height in centimeters.
- **Weight Input**: Enter your weight in kilograms.
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculate your BMI based on the provided height and weight.
- **Navigation**: Navigate back and forth between different stages of the application.

## Code Structure :file_folder:

The application consists of three main classes:

- `BMIcalculator`: The main class that starts the application.
- `StartFrame`: Represents the initial frame where the user selects their gender.
- `FirstFrame`: Represents the frame where the user starts the BMI calculation.
- `SecondFrame`: Represents the frame where the user enters their height and weight and calculates their BMI.

## Running the Application :rocket:

To run the application, execute the `BMIcalculator` class. The application uses Java Swing for the GUI, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## Future Improvements :bulb:

- Add more complex health metrics such as body fat percentage, muscle mass, etc.
- Improve the GUI design and user experience.
- Add the ability to save and track BMI history over time.
